### Lulus Coding Exercise

Hello!  Welcome to the Lulus coding exercise.

Using a free relational database management system of your choice (SQLite, MySQL, SQL Server Express, PostgreSQL, etc.) load the comma separated files found in the data_files directory of this project into individual database tables. Once you have done so, complete the tasks below. Many users of this test choose SQLiteStudio to load this data and perform the required exercises. SQLiteStudio allows you to easily create a database and import csv as tables.

WARNING:Please ensure that data types are properly assigned to each column regardless of which RDBMS you choose (e.g. salary as a float, ids as integers, etc). If data types are not set correctly, aggregate functions such as 'SUM, 'MAX, etc may not work correctly.

Using sql, please answer the following questions about the data that has been shared.  Submit all answers and code to us either via google doc or by sharing access to a github repo with us:

1. What is the name of the employee with the highest salary?
2. In which year did the company hire the most employees?
3. In which year/month were the most products sold? How much simple revenue (product_price * items purchased) did the company earn?
4. How many orders were placed in July 2015?
5. Provide the customer_id of the customer who has the greatest number of purchases.
6. What is the average employee salary by project?
7. Which customer has the highest net order revenue?
8. What are the most and least frequently ordered products?
9. Which employee has worked on the most projects and how much of his salary was earned while working on projects?
10. What is the salary of the employee who has worked on the fewest projects?
11. Which category has generated the most revenue all time?
12. What is the first and last order amount from each month in the data set?
13. What database did you use and why?
14. Outline the basic workflow you used to get all the data from this repo into your database
